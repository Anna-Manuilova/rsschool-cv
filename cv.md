## About myself
Learning languages has always been my passion, and I have made it my first profession. However, I have realized that I could do something else while using English, and maybe change my profession.  My friend suggested me trying to learn coding and showed me what frontend development is, and suddenly I liked it! With a six-year job experience in different areas I was able to master my soft and hard skills (mostly soft ones, of course) a good Frontend Developer should have. These include lifelong learning, time managment, good communication skills, being realible and some more. I hope these skills will help me to become a good Frontend Developer.
